### InstallerApp was the 'iTunes for jailbreakers' back during the iPhoneOS 2 days. 
It supported installation of Installler and Cydia packages from your Desktop.

While InstallerApp cannot be open sourced for multiple reasons (If you read Russian feel free to read the backstory at http://ripdev.com) the graphics should not be lost in history.
